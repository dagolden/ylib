=head1 NAME

ylib - Add paths to @INC from a config file

=head1 VERSION

This documentation describes version 0.001.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   # in .mylib file
   /home/david/some/library/path
 
   # from the command line
   $ perl -Mylib -E 'say for @INC'
   /home/david/some/library/path
   ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The ylib module adds paths to C<<< @INC >>> from a configuration file named C<<< .mylib >>>
in which each line represents a library path.  The C<<< .mylib >>> file can be either
in the current directory andE<sol>or in the user's home directory.  It is equivalent
to calling C<<< 'use lib' >>> on each path.

=head1 USAGE

Occasionally, it's useful to customize C<<< @INC >>> on a per-directory basis without
changing the global C<<< PERL5LIB >>> environment variable.  For example, when
developing or testing code that requires uninstalled code in an adjancent
directory, one could create a C<<< .mylib >>> file that adds the necessary path.

For example, consider this directory tree with two Perl distributions, Foo-Bar
and Baz-Bam:

   ~/projects/
       Foo-Bar/
       Baz-Bam/

The code in Foo-Bar depends on code in Baz-Bam.  So in Foo-Bar, create a
C<<< .mylib >>> file with the appropriate path:

   $ cd Foo-Bar
   $ echo '../Baz-Bam/lib' > .mylib
   $ perl -Mylib Build.PL
   $ Build && Build test

That's easier and shorter than using PERL5LIB on the command line, and it
scales better as the number of libraries increases.

Note: C<<< ylib >>> will issue a warning if a path in C<<< .mylib >>> can't be found.
