NAME
    ylib - Add paths to @INC from a config file

VERSION
    This documentation describes version 0.001.

SYNOPSIS
       # in .mylib file
       /home/david/some/library/path
     
   # from the command line
       $ perl -Mylib -E 'say for @INC'
       /home/david/some/library/path
       ...

DESCRIPTION
    The ylib module adds paths to @INC from a configuration file named
    ".mylib" in which each line represents a library path. The ".mylib" file
    can be either in the current directory and/or in the user's home
    directory. It is equivalent to calling 'use lib' on each path.

USAGE
    Occasionally, it's useful to customize @INC on a per-directory basis
    without changing the global "PERL5LIB" environment variable. For
    example, when developing or testing code that requires uninstalled code
    in an adjancent directory, one could create a ".mylib" file that adds
    the necessary path.

    For example, consider this directory tree with two Perl distributions,
    Foo-Bar and Baz-Bam:

       ~/projects/
           Foo-Bar/
           Baz-Bam/

    The code in Foo-Bar depends on code in Baz-Bam. So in Foo-Bar, create a
    ".mylib" file with the appropriate path:

       $ cd Foo-Bar
       $ echo '../Baz-Bam/lib' > .mylib
       $ perl -Mylib Build.PL
       $ Build && Build test

    That's easier and shorter than using PERL5LIB on the command line, and
    it scales better as the number of libraries increases.

    Note: "ylib" will issue a warning if a path in ".mylib" can't be found.
